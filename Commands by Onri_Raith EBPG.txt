# a neat technique for recording coordinates below, involves typing in the last 3 numbers after the decimal (to the right of the decimal, followed by entering the remaining numbers to the left of the decimal.

# (Use this to record SEM coordinates prior to performing "joyplus")

# "joyplus" marker instructions (be sure to gradually zoom in to the desired joymarker locations on the chip):

joyplus >> follow prompt to center desired marker locations on SEM window.

(find each marker manually upon 2nd prompt to center marker locations on SEM window - this is a confirmation)
Press Enter for each confirmed coordinate (it should result in a "found" joymarker).


# After entering real coordinates, enter the job command as shown above >> after the command runs, there will be a prompt that will allow you to use the built-in SEM to confirm or adjust the location of virtual, joy markers >> let exposure run.
