# The sequence of steps found below should be followed in relatively chronological order and can be used as a chronological checklist for installing Qiskit Metal.

# Install Jupyter.
# Install Anaconda.
# Open Command Prompt >> type (git --version) to be sure git is there >> type (conda --version) to be sure a conda variation is there.
# Install Visual Studio Installer >> install Visual Studio Community (Check the boxes on the right-side panel or under the Individual Components tab & be sure to select Windows 10 or 11 SDK). [pip install gdspy won't be able to build wheels without an updated Visual Studio or Visual Studio Build Tools].
# Open Anaconda Prompt as admin.
# Type (conda env create -n <name of custom quantum environment> .\environment.yml). [If there is an error, likely it is because there is no yml file type located there. The yml file type is needed for this to work].
# Open a new Command Prompt window [run as administrator] >> type (conda update -n base -c defaults conda) >> press Enter >> when prompted to proceed with update, type (y) >> press Enter >> close command window.
# Activate the quantum environment: type (conda activate <name of custom quantum environment>) or if that doesn't work, type (CALL conda.bat activate <name of custom quantum environment>) >> press Enter. (<name of custom quantum environment>) should show as a result.
# Install Qiskit Metal by typing (pip install qiskit-metal or pip install qiskit_metal).
# To add darkmode to Qiskit Metal, type (pip install qdarkstyle).
# To update Qiskit Metal, type (pip install --upgrade qiskit_metal).
# If the install is bringing up an error, be sure to restart entire system.
